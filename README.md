Model Benchmarking & Tuning 
Project Goals
This project serves as a comprehensive study on model selection and hyperparameter optimization using the Scikit-Learn ecosystem.

Key Features
Multi-Model Pipeline: Concurrent training of Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.

Automated Tuning: Implementation of RandomizedSearchCV for parameter search.

Performance Visualization: Generation of Confusion Matrices and ROC/PR Curves for deep diagnostic analysis.

Core Metrics
The tuned Random Forest reached a 97.3% accuracy rate. The project emphasizes the F1-Score, as it represents a robust harmonic mean between precision and recall, ensuring the model is reliable for both Malignant and Benign classification.

Implementation Notes
Environment: Visual Studio Code.

Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.
